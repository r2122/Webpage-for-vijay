        Actor Vijay's speech at his party Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) even is being lauded by public and political pundits. Hailing Vijay's speech, senior journalist Sumanth Raman, on his X account, said, "This is a very powerful speech by @actorvijay. Honestly I never expected such a fiery speech. 👏👏👏." He also predicted that the actor might become Deputy Chief Minister.Periyar is our primary ideological leader. But, we will not adopt his atheism ideology alone. We neither agree nor believe in it. However, as former Chief Minister CN Annadurai said, we stand by One Race, One God principle (Ondre Kulam, Oruvane Thevan). Nevertheless, we will embrace all other principles of Periyar including education for women, equality for all and social justice politics," The Print quoted Vijay as saying at Vikravandi.
